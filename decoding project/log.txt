7/7:

-converted npy arrays into matlab ones
-explored code and readme, learned that:

	The code generates a set of Gabor wavelets (created using trig functions in a matlab function) and multiples each to the original image (F = Gfwd * I) to obtain a set of Gabor "features" called F. These features are then linearly combined to reconstruct the original image.

-read TSL paper about 2D Gabor image reconstruction (confused)

-used Tang stimuli with demo program to reconstruct images, noted that Tang data has dark bars at the bottom and left edges (which may interfere with reconstruction)

-wrote my own code, loaded all datasets and the first image of the natural stimuli (monkey) in grayscale

-the open-source MATLAB script is an interactive tool/visualizer that allows you to see the wavelets being added, so need to modify to just reconstruct

-obtained the set of filter values (res), then reconstructed succesfully

-center crop down to 40x40
